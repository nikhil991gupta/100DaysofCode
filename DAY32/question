Implemention of Multithreading using Runnable Interface

used to execute code on a concurrent thread. 
It is an interface which is implemented by any 
class if we want that the instances of that class should be executed by a thread.

To create a thread using runnable, use the following code-

Runnable runnable = new MyRunnable();    
  
Thread thread = new Thread(runnable);  
thread.start();  
It is the easiest way to create a thread by implementing Runnable.
 One can create a thread on any object by implementing Runnable.
  To implement a Runnable, one has only to implement the run method.

public void run()

In this method, we have the code which we want to execute on a concurrent thread. 
 we can use variables, instantiate classes, and perform an action 
 like the same way the main thread does. The thread remains until 
 the return of this method. The run method establishes an entry point to a new thread.
